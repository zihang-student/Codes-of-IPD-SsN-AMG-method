# Codes-of-IPD-SsN-AMG-method
This is an AMG-SsN based accelerated primal-dual method for discrete OT problem. Details of the algorithm can be found in "A fast solver for generalized optimal transport problems based on dynamical system and algebraic multigrid", preprinted on arXiv:2207.14082. 

To solve the discrete OT problem, one needs to run APD_SsN_Class1.m in file Class1. For the partial OT problem, run APD_SsN_Class2.m in file Class2. The InputData file contains some input examples.

The algorithm is developed by Jun Hu, Hao Luo and Zihang Zhang. For any questions, please feel free contact us at luohao@math.pku.edu.cn or zhang-zihang@pku.edu.cn.
