# Codes-of-IPD-SsN-AMG-method based on MATLAB


This is an AMG-SsN based accelerated primal-dual method for discrete optimal transport (OT) problems. Details of the algorithm can be found in "A fast solver for generalized optimal transport problems based on dynamical system and algebraic multigrid", preprinted on arXiv:2207.14082, 2021. 


DECLARATION: The main code has not been optimized. It is not a well-prepared toolbox but only for sharing and discussion, as public supplementary of our paper. We provide two demos respectively in Class1/ and Class2/, with some input examples. 

>> For OT, run the m-file APD_SsN_Class1.m

>> For partial OT, run the m-file APD_SsN_Class2.m

All programs have been tested successfully in MATLAB, and the input data can be modified properly as needed.
