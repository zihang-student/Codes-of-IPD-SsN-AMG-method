# Codes-of-IPD-SsN-AMG-method based on MATLAB


This is an AMG-SsN based accelerated primal-dual method for discrete optimal transport (OT) problems. Details of the algorithm can be found in "A fast solver for generalized optimal transport problems based on dynamical system and algebraic multigrid", preprinted on arXiv:2207.14082, 2021. 

To solve the discrete OT problem, run APD_SsN_Class1.m in file Class1. For the partial OT problem, run APD_SsN_Class2.m in file Class2. The InputData file contains some input examples.

This algorithm has not been optimized, and is only intended for communication and reference purposes. The program has been ensured to run properly in the MATLAB environment, and the input data can be modified as needed for the problem.

The algorithm is developed by Jun Hu, Hao Luo and Zihang Zhang. For any questions, please feel free to contact us by luohao@math.pku.edu.cn or zhang-zihang@pku.edu.cn.
